# graphdetection

This is the code for image graph detection. It connect the object detection, attribute recognition and relation detection in images into a graph, which is expected to help a bunch of high level tasks, such as image captioning, visual question answering, expression reference, etc.

### TODO list

- [] Try Pytorch faster RCNN code[https://github.com/longcw/faster_rcnn_pytorch], and ensure it works.
- [] Data preparation for Visual Genome Dataset.
- [] Train extended faster RCNN model on Visual Genome Dataset.
